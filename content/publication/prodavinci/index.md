summary: "We present the findings of our undergraduate thesis work on the Economic Complexity of Venezuelan States. We argue that middle per capita income levels cannot be sustained by oil exports alone, as it was possible decades ago. Thus, developing new productive capabilities is imperative. This work aims to guide fuure productive development efforts in Venezuela."
